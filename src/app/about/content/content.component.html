    <!-- Biography -->
    <p>
      I am a software engineer, content creator, and origami enthusiast. I focus
      primarily on Python, JavaScript, modding Minecraft in Java, and web
      development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have studied at Brigham Young University - Idaho, and created quite a
      few personal projects. I have a main page at
      <a href="https://www.fsixninja.dev" target="_blank"
        >https://www.fsixninja.dev</a
      >, which contains links to my learning projects through my tenure in
      school. You will also find links to my favorite personal projects, like a
      2D solar system animation, a blog, and a grocery shopping tool. This
      project will also be linked there.
    </p>

    <!-- Contact -->
    <p>
      For more information, please feel free to reach out to me through
      <a routerLink="/contact">the Contact page</a>. I am always open to
      discussing new projects and technologies, learning new skills, debugging
      pesky code, and working on professional and personal projects.
